[🇺🇸 English](README.en.md) | [🇨🇳 中文文档](README.md)

This project is aimed at regular users who want to auto-claim Epic Games weekly freebies. The default setup runs on GitHub Actions, so you do not need a server or a machine that stays online all the time. If you have a GitHub account, you can get started directly.

The project is built on top of community open-source work and now includes domestic `GLM` multimodal support. In practice it can handle login, captcha solving, and the claim flow reliably. If Google AI Studio or the Gemini API is inconvenient for you, the GLM path is usually easier and can often be run at `0` cost.

If you choose the `GLM` route, you usually need to complete Zhipu's real-name verification first, or the API may not be available to your account.

If you do not have a Zhipu account yet, you can register through this invite link: [BigModel.cn invite link](https://www.bigmodel.cn/invite?icode=A75tQCByIvrO4k6SLkU5BQZ3c5owLmCCcMQXWcJRS8E%3D).

Community discussion and feedback are welcome on [LINUX DO](https://linux.do/t/topic/2036835/4).

## Feature Overview

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Auto login | Signs in to your Epic account automatically |
| Weekly freebies discovery | Fetches and identifies currently claimable free titles |
| Auto claim | Opens product pages and completes the checkout flow |
| Captcha handling | Supports login captcha and checkout security checks |
| Scheduled execution | Can run directly on GitHub Actions |

GitHub Actions is the recommended runtime because it does not require your own machine to stay online, and the workflow is already included in this repository.

## Why GLM Is Recommended

If this is your first time using a project like this, starting with GLM is usually the easiest path. The reasons are practical:

- Less configuration: in most cases you only need `GLM_API_KEY` and `GLM_MODEL`.
- Lower cost: the free quota of `glm-4.6v` is often enough for the weekly-claim use case.
- More stable for this project: `glm-4.6v-flash` can occasionally fail under load with "the current model is too busy", so `glm-4.6v` is the safer default.
- Better fit for users in China: you do not need to solve Google AI Studio registration or availability first.
- Capability already validated: login captcha, checkout verification, drag, click, and multi-select challenges have all been verified in real runs.

---

## Before You Start

- Your Epic account email and password.
- Epic account 2FA must be disabled (email, SMS, or authenticator app).
- A GLM account with `GLM_API_KEY` prepared for captcha solving.

This project runs in a headless automation environment. If the account still requires email codes, SMS codes, or authenticator approval, the flow will usually get stuck.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

In most cases, the first successful validation can be finished in about 10 minutes.

### 1. Fork the repository and enable Actions

- Fork the repo to your own GitHub account. A private fork is recommended.
- Open `Actions` and enable the workflow named `Epic Awesome Gamer (Scheduled)`.

### 2. Configure Secrets

Go to `Settings` -> `Secrets and variables` -> `Actions`, then fill in these five values first:

If you plan to use `GLM_API_KEY`, make sure the related Zhipu account has already passed real-name verification, or the API may remain unavailable.

| Secret | Example value |
| --- | --- |
| `EPIC_EMAIL` | Your Epic email |
| `EPIC_PASSWORD` | Your Epic password |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | glm |
| `GLM_API_KEY` | Your Zhipu API key |
| `GLM_MODEL` | glm-4.6v |

Configuration page example:
![GLM API setup](docs/images/tutorial/GLM-API.png)

![GitHub Actions Secrets example](docs/images/tutorial/step2-actions-secrets.png)

Optional notes:

- Leave `GLM_BASE_URL` empty to use the default value.
- `glm-4.6v` is the recommended `GLM_MODEL`; `glm-4.6v-flash` can fail during peak traffic.
- Leave `CHALLENGE_CLASSIFIER_MODEL`, `IMAGE_CLASSIFIER_MODEL`, `SPATIAL_POINT_REASONER_MODEL`, and `SPATIAL_PATH_REASONER_MODEL` empty if you want them to follow `GLM_MODEL`.
- If you want the Gemini route instead, set `LLM_PROVIDER=gemini` and configure `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

### 3. Run the workflow manually once

- Open the `Actions` page.
- Select `Epic Awesome Gamer (Scheduled)`.
- Click `Run workflow`.

### 4. Check the logs

When the run succeeds, the logs usually contain lines like:

```text
Login success
Right account validation success
Authentication completed
Starting free games collection process
All week-free games are already in the library
```

Note: you may still see intermediate errors such as `wait for captcha response timeout` or `btoa is read-only`. In the current flow these can be non-fatal noise. If the run ends with success logs and exits normally, the execution can still be treated as successful.

Example log with warnings but final success:

## Run Logs and Artifacts

Each GitHub Actions run uploads two artifacts automatically:

| Artifact | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `epic-runtime-<run_id>` | Runtime screenshots, debug text, and `purchase_debug` files |
| `epic-logs-<run_id>` | Runtime logs |

Download location:

1. Open the specific Actions run page.
2. Scroll to the bottom.
3. Find `Artifacts`.
4. Download the zip files.

What to inspect first:

| Package | What to inspect first |
| --- | --- |
| `epic-runtime-<run_id>.zip` | After extraction, check the screenshots and debug text inside `purchase_debug/` first |
| `epic-logs-<run_id>.zip` | After extraction, open the log files directly |

These files are generated and uploaded after each GitHub Actions run. They are not fixed directories pre-shipped in the repository root.

## FAQ

### 1. Login sometimes fails and sometimes succeeds

That is normal. GitHub Actions uses shared cloud IPs and Epic is sensitive to risk control. Typical symptoms include a captcha that passes once and fails the next time, occasional `captcha_invalid`, or the same account succeeding again after some delay.

### 2. The page shows `One more step`

This is not automatically a bug. It is Epic's extra human-verification step during checkout.

The project can already handle this secondary verification. Seeing the popup below does not mean the automation is broken:

![Checkout Security Check](docs/images/faq/checkout-security-check.png)

### 3. The page shows `Device not supported`

This usually happens when the product officially supports Windows while GitHub Actions is running on Linux.

### 4. Why can the workflow report success while the game is not in the library?

Historically, the common root causes were:

| Cause | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Product-page state recognition was inaccurate | The page copy and the real state did not match |
| `Place Order` was clicked but checkout was still incomplete | The checkout page was still blocked by a security check |
| Another popup interrupted the flow | For example `Device not supported` or an extra confirmation |
| Older logic misclassified page text | Some non-ownership text was previously misread as "already owned" |

### 5. Why do logs sometimes show `btoa is read-only`?

That is compatibility noise from `hcaptcha-challenger` while injecting an HSW script on certain pages. It does not always mean the current run failed.

## Docker Deployment

If you do not want to use GitHub Actions, you can also run the project on your own server, NAS, or local Docker environment.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ronchy2000/epic-freebies-helper.git
cd epic-freebies-helper
```

### 2. Edit the configuration

The main entry is [`docker/docker-compose.yaml`](docker/docker-compose.yaml).

GLM example:

```yaml
environment:
  - LLM_PROVIDER=glm
  - GLM_API_KEY=your_glm_key
  - GLM_BASE_URL=https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4
  - GLM_MODEL=glm-4.6v
```

Gemini / AiHubMix example:

```yaml
environment:
  - LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
  - GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
  - GEMINI_BASE_URL=https://aihubmix.com
  - GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro
```

### 3. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
